# Classification Basics: Walkthrough with the Iris DataÂ Set
## Learn the basics of classification with guided code from the iris data set
When I was first learning how to code, I would apply different data skills to different data sets to create Jupyter Notebook references for myself.

Hopefully this is a positive resource for those learning to use Python for data science, and something that can be referenced along the way.
